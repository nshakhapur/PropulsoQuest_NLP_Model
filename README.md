# PropulsoQuest

## Overview

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model tailored for answering questions related to propulsion technologies. The model is built on state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures and is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset of scientific research papers and studies in the field of propulsion.

## Features

- Utilizes transformer-based models for accurate and context-aware question answering.
- Pre-trained on a wide range of propulsion research papers to ensure domain-specific knowledge.
- Provides detailed answers to questions related to propulsion technology, research, and applications.
- Streamlined user interface for easy interaction and querying.

## Questions you can ask:
1. what is the primary goal of the papers?
2. How can we observe the burning rates?

## Note

This model is based on a huge data, hence cannot be deployed independently. 
I have attached the snippets of the working model. Please do give it a read!
If the website says it's not available, it is primarily due to the memory consumption. 
It is a practice model, hence results might not be accurate at a times.
